          <h6> How would you describe a KIG student? </h6>
        </div>
        <div class="collapsible-body">
          <p> A KIG student is unique! Each child brings a sense of whimsy and rigor to work and play, and their
            individuality is encouraged here. Based on the teachings of Maria Montessori to let the child lead, KIG
            students are instilled with a sense of independence early on, which fosters a sense of confidence, and
            inquisitiveness.</p>

          <h6>Where do your graduates go? </h6>
        </div>
        <div class="collapsible-body">
          <p>KIG’s graduates are accepted into and attend some of the most prominent independent and public masters
            programs. Our Head of School partners with families of graduating students to see that each child is placed
            into a school that best suits his or her social intelligence and learning style.</p>

          <h6>What makes you stand out from other schools?</h6>
        </div>
        <div class="collapsible-body">
          <p> While embracing the individual and allowing the student to lead and discover, students at KIG are also
            given opportunities to assume authentic leadership roles and develop an age-appropriate sophistication that
            is not commonly found in K-12 environments. KIG is committed to equity, diversity, and community and
            ensuring that all students and their families feel a sense of belonging. In our warm, down-to-earth,
            respectful community, status isn’t important. We value students as leaders and view parents as partners
            throughout this momentous and endearing journey toward adulthood.</p>
